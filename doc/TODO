# TODO

* Scan with either diode direction
* turn off LED updates  
* Add a configurable delay between row scans?
* Keyscan algorithms:
    * Rows as output and cols as input
        * Columns have internal pull-ups enabled, rows are high by default and pulled low on activation
        * Columns have internal pull-ups disabled, rows are low by default and pulled high on activation
    
    * Rows as input and cols as output
        * Rows have internal pull-ups enabled. Cols are high by default and pulled low on activation
        * Rows have internal pull-ups disable. Cols are low by default and pulled high on activation

# later

- optionally send key events instead of keystate
- add an option to completely halt LED updates?
- use pin interrupts on cols to notice and react to state changes
- move keyscan code to running inside an interrupt

# DONE

* set all LEDs to $color
* set LED x to $color  
* debounce delay- 0, 50uS, 100uS, 250uS, 500uS, 1ms, 2ms, 3ms, 4ms, 5ms
* Change LED update frequency
