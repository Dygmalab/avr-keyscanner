14:58 <[DMA]> I would think, since you don't need to care that much about EMI, 0111 for keydown and 10000000 for key up with 
              2kHz scanning will get what you want.
14:59 <[DMA]> 1.5ms activation delay in good cases, 4ms release delay
14:59 <[DMA]> One very important specific there is to only detect key releases when key is logically pressed.
15:00 <[DMA]> but that only matters when you transfer scancodes, not matrix state
15:00 <[DMA]> I had problem of spammy release scancodes :)
15:01 <[DMA]> 2kHz scanning is needed to detect EMI in less than 1ms
15:03 <[DMA]> a good source of EMI is a lamp dimmer, btw.
15:03 <[DMA]> and cheap! :)
