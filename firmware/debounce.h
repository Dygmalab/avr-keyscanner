/**
 * debounce --
 *    The debouncer is based on a stacked counter implementation, with each bit
 *    getting its own 2-bit counter. When a bit changes, a call to debounce
 *    will increment that bit's counter. When it overflows, the change is
 *    comitted to the final debounced state and the changed bit returned.
 *
 *    Because each key's counter and state are stored in this stacked way,
 *    8 keys are processed in parallel at each operation.
 *
 * args:
 *    sample - the current state
 *    debouncer - the state variables of the debouncer
 *
 * returns: bits that have changed in the final debounced state
 *
 * handy XOR truth table:   A  B  O
 *                          0  0  0
 *                          0  1  1
 *                          1  0  1
 *                          1  1  0
 * 
 * This is used below as a difference detector:
 *   if A ^ B is true, A and B are different.
 *
 * And a way to flip selected bits in a variable or register:
 *   Set B to 1, then A ^ B = !A
