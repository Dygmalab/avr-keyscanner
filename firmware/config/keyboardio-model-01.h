 * Two have special functionality of interest to the application:
 *     PORTB: used by ISP
 *     PORTC: used by TWI/IÂ²C

// Should we be treating our columns as outputs or our rows?
// If the columns are outputs, our keyscanning loop has to do twice as much work,
// as we have 8 columns and four rows. However, it means that we're able to drive
// the column pins high, keeping the row pins low. When doing a read, we're pushing
// a lot more power through the circuit. If there's a marginal connection, this should,
// theoretically, get us much cleaner reads.
//
// If COLS_ARE_OUTPUTS is NOT defined, we treat our rows as outputs.
// To do this we, turn on pull-up resistors on the columns and drive the rows
// LOW when we want to read them. This is a pretty traditional scheme. It's less work
// but, in theory, will not get us reads that are as clean as the other way round.
